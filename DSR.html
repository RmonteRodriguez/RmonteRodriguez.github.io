									<h2>Summary</h2>
									<p>Dreamscape Runners is a fast-paced 2D speed-running platformer where players race against the clock—or each other—through challenging, dream-like landscapes. The goal is to beat your best time or compete head-to-head with another player to reach the finish line. Along the way, players can collect and strategically use a variety of power-ups, such as speed boosts, and gravity-defying abilities, to gain the upper hand. </p>

									<h2>Design Goals</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>Design a simple yet fun game to allow our programmer to adjust to Unity</li>
										<li>Design a game that had fast-paced gameplay</li>
										<li>Design a game that also included some form of combat</li>
										<li>Design levels that use the power ups to get an advantage</li>

								<h1>What I Worked On</h1>
							</div>

						</div>
						<div class="column-3">
						  <div class="leftText">
							  <h2>Single/Multiplayer capability</h2>
							  <p>I wanted to introduce local multiplayer so players could race against each other. This was my first experience implementing local multiplayer, and one of the initial challenges was getting power-ups and enemies to interact with both players. During the early prototype, I had hard-coded interactions to only recognize the first player, which caused issues. After refactoring the code, I was able to ensure that enemies and power-ups now correctly interact with any player that comes into contact with them.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="rightText">
							<ul>
								<h2>Variety of Power Ups</h2>
								<p>I added a variety of power-ups that players can use against enemies or other players. These include one-time use power-ups, like grenades that can destroy parts of the level or damage enemies, as well as reusable power-ups, like the Freeze ability, which immobilizes both enemies and players. Balancing these power-ups was crucial; each one was designed with both benefits and trade-offs. For example, the Balloon power-up increases jump height and reduces fall speed but slightly slows the player’s movement. Despite challenges with multiplayer integration, ensuring power-up balance was key to maintaining a fun and fair gameplay experience.</p>  
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="column-3">
						<div class="leftText">
							<h2>Speedrun Timer</h2>
							<p>To track player performance, I implemented a speedrun timer that records each player’s best time. The main challenge was ensuring each player had their own timer, especially for the multiplayer mode, so we could display individual times at the end of the race. After overcoming this, I set it up so that when a player crosses the finish line, their time is saved and displayed on the post-race scene.</p>

								<h2>Variety of hazards/enemies</h2>
								<p>To keep gameplay engaging, we needed hazards and enemies. While adding hazards was straightforward, implementing enemies proved more challenging. Initially, I had hard-coded enemies to interact only with the first player, which caused issues when I added multiplayer, breaking enemy behavior. After fixing that, I faced another problem: enemies would fall through the level, walk off platforms, or get stuck in walls. I resolved these issues by fine-tuning the rigidbodies for better collision detection and ensuring enemies only spawned once the race started. This allowed the level to fully load with its collisions before the enemies appeared, preventing them from malfunctioning.</p>
